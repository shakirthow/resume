				<h1> Thank you for visitng my site!</h1>

				<p>I currently work for a large investment bank in a team that provides Unix support for specialized trading groups. I have worked on web apps that have used Ruby (sinatra) as backend and several other scripts that have been widely adopted by users within the firm. I also have extensive experience in building mobile apps for both iOS and Android. I am a big fan of clean, reusable code and all my programs are not only well structured but also thoroughly documented. <br><br>

					For my next step I’m looking towards scaling up the user base that I target. I am a quick learner and able to rapidly adapt to new environments - both virtual and geographical. I'm passionate about technology and anxious to work with others like me. <br><br>
					I’d absolutely love to talk to you about the Google App Engine, Ruby, BMWs, 3-D scanners, Sri Lanka, Germany and skiing among other things.
